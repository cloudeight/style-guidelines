## Introduction

When contributing to this projects' repository, we ask that you first create a new issue to discuss the changes you wish to make and follow our Pull Request rules and Code of Conduct below.

## Issues

When creating a new issue, try and use one of the templates provided and fill them out as best as possible. This helps resolve the issue in a much better time frame. If none of the templates are relevant to your issue, try and be as detailed as possible and maybe recommend a new template that can be used in the future.

## Pull Requests

There are whole set of best practices and guidelines for various aspects of developing a project which can be found in our companies [style guidelines](https://github.com/cloudeight/style-guidelines) documentation project.

We understand that each project is different and may require veering off the guidelines to some extent but we try and keep these guidelines as up to date, useful and relevant as possible.

If you can see any way that these guidelines can be improved, we'll be glad to listen and discuss how to progress them further.

With that said, use these steps to ensure a smooth contribution:

1. Read the relevant coding languages guidelines for best practices to keep consistency within the codebase.
2. Follow our git commit, version control and changelog guidelines to keep consistency throughout the development process of the project.
3. If a language or development process isn't outlined in any of our guidelines, get in touch and ask, we'll be glad to help if it means keeping the project coherent and understandable.
4. Read through the current code, pick up on how the developers have approached the project and try and get a feel for the same workflow.
5. All relevant documentation and README.md files should be updated reflecting all the changes made in the update.
6. Create a single pull request per feature, if you've added multiple features, send multiple pull requests.

### Do

  - Use friendly and welcoming language.
  - Be respectful of other peoples viewpoints and experiences.

### Don't
